# Design Concepts for the REopt Module

At a high level each REopt model consists of four major components:

1. The Scenario as defined by the user's inputs and default values.
2. The REoptInputs, which convert the `Scenario` into the necessary values for the REopt mathematical program.
3. The REopt Model (built here), which includes all the constraints and the objective function that are built using the REoptInputs
4. And the results, which are returned to the user and derived from the optimal solution of the REopt Model.

The REopt Model is built via the build\_reopt! method. However, the run\_reopt method includes `build_reopt!` within it so typically a user does not need to directly call `build_reopt!` (unless they wish to modify the model before solving it, eg. by adding a constraint).

run\_reopt is the main interface for users.

## Technology size constraints

### Upper size limits

The `max_kw` input value for any technology is considered to be the maximum *additional* capacity that may be installed beyond the `existing_kw`. Note also that the `Site` space constraints (`roof_squarefeet` and `land_acres`) for `PV` technologies can be less than the provided `max_kw` value.

### Lower size limits

The `min_kw` input value for any technology sets the lower bound on the capacity. If `min_kw` is non-zero then the model will be forced to choose at least that system size. The `min_kw` value is set equal to the `existing_kw` value in the Business As Usual scenario.

# Business As Usual Scenario

In order to calculate the Net Present Value of the optimal solution, as well as other baseline metrics, one can optionally run the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario. When an array of `JuMP.Model`s is provided to `run_reopt` the BAU scenario is also run. For example:

```
m1 = Model(optimizer_with_attributes(Xpress.Optimizer, "OUTPUTLOG" => 0))
m2 = Model(optimizer_with_attributes(Xpress.Optimizer, "OUTPUTLOG" => 0))
results = run_reopt([m1,m2], "./scenarios/pv_storage.json")
```

The BAU scenario is created by modifying the REoptInputs (created from the user's Scenario). In the BAU scenario we have the following assumptions:

- Each existing technology has zero capital cost, but does have operations and maintenance costs.
- The ElectricTariff, Financial, Site, ElectricLoad, and ElectricUtility inputs are the same as the optimal case.
- The `min_kw` and `max_kw` values are set to the `existing_kw` value.
