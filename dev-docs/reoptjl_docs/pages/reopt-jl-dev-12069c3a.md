# REopt.jl

REopt.jl is the core module of the REopt® techno-economic decision support platform, developed by the National Laboratory of the Rockies (NLR). REopt optimizes the sizing and dispatch of integrated energy systems for buildings, campuses, communities, microgrids, and more. REopt identifies the cost-optimal mix of generation, storage, and heating and cooling technologies to meet cost savings, resilience, emissions reductions, and energy performance goals. The open-source REopt.jl code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/NatLabRockies/REopt.jl.

## Installing

REopt evaluations for all system types except GHP (see below) can be performed using the following installation instructions from the package manager mode (`]`) of the Julia REPL:

```
(active_env) pkg> add REopt JuMP HiGHS
```
### Add NLR developer API key for PV, CST, and Wind

If you don't have an NLR developer network API key, sign up here on https://developer.nlr.gov to get one (free); this is required to load PV and Wind resource profiles from PVWatts and the Wind Toolkit APIs from within REopt.jl. Assign your API key to the expected environment variable:

```
ENV["NREL_DEVELOPER_API_KEY"]="your API key"
```

before running PV or Wind scenarios, and also assign your email to the expected environment variable as well before running CST scenarios:

```
ENV["NREL_DEVELOPER_EMAIL"]="your contact email"
```
### Additional package loading for GHP

GHP evaluations must load in the `GhpGhx.jl` package separately because it has a more restrictive license and is not a registered Julia package.

Install gcc via homebrew (if running on a Mac).

Add the GhpGhx.jl package to the project's dependencies from the package manager (`]`):

```
(active_env) pkg> add "https://github.com/NatLabRockies/GhpGhx.jl"
```

Load in the package from the script where `run_reopt()` is called:

```
using GhpGhx
```
